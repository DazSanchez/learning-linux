# Linux Shell Basics Practice

Using your current knowledge about linux shell basics, perform the following exercise:

1. Print to screen the value of the `$PATH` env variable.
2. Create an env variable called `$SECRET_VALUE` with `secure-string` as value.
3. List all available env variables on the current terminal.
4. Write to a file called `answer.txt` the syntax of the command that would solve the following question:
   - How can I print recursively the contents of a directory using `ls` command?
5. Save the output of the previous command into a file called `recursive-list.txt`.
6. Execute the command `hello` and write the error into a file called `hello.error`.
