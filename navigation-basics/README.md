# Navigations Basics Practice

Using your current knowledge about basic navigation and file management on a Linux terminal perform the following exercise:

1. Create a directory `navigation`.
2. Create a file `example.txt` with the following contents on it (**do not use a text editor**):

   ```
   This is an example.
   I'm using a Linux terminal!
   ```

3. Move the `example.txt` file into a new directory called `nested` while also renaming the file to `renamed.txt`.
4. Create a new file called `linux-directories.txt`.
5. Write the answers to the following questions into that file (**do not use a text editor**):
   - What's is the porpuse of `/home` directory?
   - What's the path to the directory for Linux's system administration binaries?
   - What's is the porpuse of `/var` and `/etc` directories?
6. Delete the `nested` directory while asking the user for confirmation to delete the files.
